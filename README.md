# Volvo S60R carputer project

## Goal
Use the telescoping screen for the Volvo navigation to a pi zero.
Use steering wheel controls as input.
Read car params from OBD2.
Pi will control up and down of screen.

### Other

I have ruled out the stock screen for now, I will put in place a 5 inch touch screen but touch will not be the main way to use the screen.
I will have 3d printed parts to hold the screen and pi there they need to be.
I will try to include parts used.
